    /*
    the deal with this is simple. we just need to find the peak elements. so for that.
    we need to check are we on strickly increasing side or stricky decreasing side.

    so for that. what we do. we check if our mid is less then next element. then
    we are on strickly increasing side. so we just need to go to right side.
    for that we just do mid+1;

    and if we are on the. stricly decreasing side so for that we just need to go to 
    left side because we now  the left side we will get the at some point. a element
    will be the greater then right side.
    so we just need to reach over there so for that we just do mid-1;
    and also we store our middle index. because there may be the case we are on the peak elements . how ? because there can be the case there no left side strickly increaseing we are laying on the current peak element. so we have to store the value.

    after that all the process done. we just return the mid idndex.

An array arr a mountain if the following properties hold:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] 
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
Given a mountain array arr, return the index i such that arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].

You must solve it in O(log(arr.length)) time complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 106
arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
