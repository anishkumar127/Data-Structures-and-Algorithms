        return -1;
    }
    /**
    
    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target =0;

    so like we are checking on first part. low to mid. 
    and then also checking our target laying on that range or not.
    so if target>= our low. means starting and < less then our middle.
    so yeah target is laying. 

    so our here. we just need to high = mid-1. why because.
    we are checking low to mid so we need to mid-1. for checking other wise we go other side of the array. like mid+1 to end side. so not go there and 
    we checked our target laying on the side of. start to mid. so we check by mid-1;

    and again then check our taget not laying on the that range. so we just check on the.
    mid+1; side.

    and else conditon.
    we check second side. of the mid+1 to end side.
    our also we check is our target laying on the range of mid+1 to end ? or not.
    ok if it is laying then we just need to low = mid+1 over here why mid +1 why 
    not mid-1. because of. the we are checking on the mid+1` to end side wo we have to be go to right side. for checking. because left side we checking.
    but yeah if not in range of mid+1 to end. then we just check previous
    mid-1 side. if there is present or not. ok.

    so if there present then return it. if not then return it -1. because in whole array its didn't present. ok so yeah this is it.'

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-104 <= target <= 104
