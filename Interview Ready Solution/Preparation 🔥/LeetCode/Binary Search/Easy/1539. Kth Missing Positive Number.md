                count++;
                if(count==k){

    }
/*
2 3 4 7 11 k 5.
missing 1 5 6 8 9 10. 

1 2 3 4 k = 2. non missing.
n +2 = 6. 
 so in that what am i doing ?

 so basically i im putting into hashmap the array elements and with the
 true value. .
 key is array elements and there frqeeuncy is true.
 ok.

 and then i needed extra size of for looping. because in the question example.
 giving the. if not missing elments then we need to return last elements +k like 1 2 3 4 not msising and k is 2. we need to 4+2 = 6. missing no.

 so what we can do ?
 and one more case. i start from 1.in question also mention. positive no. and starting from 1. 
 then what next.
 so i get size. last elements in the array. +k. bcz last elements till k our missing elements can be present.

 so for now next
 travsese the loop and.
 start from i = 1. til equal to <=size. andcheck
 if map.get(i) is not present means == null. because where we din't put any true then by Default where will be null. '

 so check iff null. then count ++. and when count equal to kth value.
 then return the i. bcz ith is the elements who missing in the kth position.

 if there nothing missing and kth not giving as a missing then return -1;

Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= 1000
arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length
