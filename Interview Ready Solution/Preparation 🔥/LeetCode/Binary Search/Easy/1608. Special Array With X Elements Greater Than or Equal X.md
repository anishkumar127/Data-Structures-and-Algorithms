    so what we need to do in this question.
    in question mention that x numbers that x numbers no in the array.
    so we need to x number from the outside. self create.
    and the constraints mention that. the nums[i] means array elemeents. can be
     the 1000 so we need to create 1000 x elements. to check.
     so we create a outer loop from 1 to 10001
     and then inner loop we traverse on the array elements.
     and check which elements are greater then the x elements.
     and with also if greater then, then we count it.
     and outside the loop after inner loop iteration complete we check/
     if count==i i means x elements then we return it count or x anything.
     and we keep doing until loop reach to end.
     after that if not any found equal then return -1 as mention in the question.

```java
class Solution {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        int[] bucket = new int [10001];
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
            bucket[nums[i]]++;
        }
        int total = nums.length;
        System.out.print(Arrays.toString(bucket));
        for(int i=0; i<1001; i++){
            if(i==total) return i;

    so in that case what we are doing.
    we storing the frequency of the elements. on there index.

    and then create total variable size of nums.
    and then again traverse til 1000 elements why 1001 ? because. if we traverse on the array length then we do wrong how ?
    3 5. there frequency will be on 3 and 5 index.
    if we define nums array length then tere length is 2. and we not able to go to till the 3 5 index. and then its will be wrong. so we will define 1001 index. because we able to check all the index frequency.

    and then if i index == nums length then return it. other wise.
    we minus - frequency from the nums length.
    nums size - frequency of bucket and then again check.
    if we found then return it else we 
    return -1;

    3 5 case how i equal to total ? because we are not reaching to 3 5 index. not doing bucket frequency minus ?

    so here is way.
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

    there i =0; i=1 and i = 2. there i = 2. and total also will be remain 2. because of.
    bucket also bucket[i] will be 0. because no index presnet 0 1 2 so java by default fill 0 value. so we minus every time 2-0. and at one time i==2 and total also 2 
    so i ==2  2==2 return 2.
