```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long s =0; 
        long e = n;
        while(s<=e){
            long mid = s+(e-s)/2;
            if((mid*(mid+1)/2)>n){
                e = mid-1;
            }else if((mid*(mid+1)/2)<=n){
                s=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return (int)s-1;
    }
}

// 1 2 3 4 5 
so we want to check sum of any location then we do. formala
k(k+1)/2; 
like sum of till 3.
3(3+1)/2 = 3(4)/2= 12 /2 = 6.
5(5+1)/2 = 5(6)/2 = 30/2 = 15.

so we check if sum greater then dreease the pointer.
if sum less then we need to maximum used coin. so we do mid+1 into s.

in the end return s-1; where last all used coin present.
```


```java
// brute force
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
       int i=1;
       int ans =0;
       while(n>=i){
           n-=i;
           ans++;
           i++;
       }
       return ans;
    }
}
starting 1. bcz one coin put it.
then ans start from 0;
and then till loop n > = i; like i<=n;
so just decreased used coin.
and incrase answer.
and increase coin.
and then again check and then again decrased used coin and. then again increase ans and used coin by ++;
```



```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        return (int)(Math.sqrt(2 * (long) n + 0.25)-0.50);
    }
    /*
    O(1)
     âˆš2N+1/4-1/3; 
     */
}

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:


Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
