You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the i<sup>th</sup> student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference** between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.

Return _the **minimum** possible difference_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [90], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   0 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        int s =0;
        int e =k-1;
        int n = nums.length-1;
        int ans =Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Arrays.sort(nums); //  Arrays.parallelSort(nums);
        while(e<=n){
            int diff = nums[e]-nums[s];
            ans = Math.min(diff,ans);
            s++;
            e++;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
/*
Arrays.parallelSort(nums); its do fasted sorting.

             // System.out.print(nums[s]+" -> ");
        // System.out.print(nums[e]+" ");
        
        to esme 
        ye pehle 
        s chalega 0 se or e chalega 1 se ya 0 se wo decide hoga k pe.
        for example.
        k = 2;
        sort it. 1 4 7 9.
        s = 0;
        e = 2-1 = 1;
        so.
        s 1 , e 4.
        min 4-1 = 3. min 3.
        s ++ e++
        s = 4 e = 7.
        7 -4 = 3 min 3.
        s++ e  ++
        s=7  e = 9
        9-7=2 = min 2.
        return 2. 
        loop go till e<=e); bcz need to last element check also. in which case n=1 declared.
