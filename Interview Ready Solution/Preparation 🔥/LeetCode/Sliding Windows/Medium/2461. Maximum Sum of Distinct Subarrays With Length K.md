there will hashset not work. 
we need to here  sliding windows concepts and the hashmap concepts.
so over here what we are doing? we are creating a hashmap. and then puting the
k size elements into hashmap. and increase there frequency.
and then  also summing all 3 size elements.
and then
after 3 size array run. 3 elements will be summed and there frequency will also incrase to 1.

here are a edge case. one.
if there are duplicate. then not will be the hashmap size equal to 3.
because of hashmap 3 3 3 duplicate become 1. and hashmap size wil be 1.
so no currsum will and to our answer.

why we  are putting into the ans ? because of first 3 size array can we our
maximum sum.
so this are we putting into the ans variable.

if are size is 3. and all are duplicate then there no will be map size equal to 3.
and no will be put into ans variable. so simply answer variable return the 0 value.

if next case. if array size more then 3 size then we process our next interation
to 3 size to n elements.
why 3 size because we already check 3 elements. so no need t check again them.
now what we will do.
we start from the k size and till the n size.
and then we first remove our starting elements and then add next elements.

so for that we remove our left(start) elements. 0 index removed.
and then add the 3rd elements.
there array index start from 0. that case 3 elements we din't cover . because above our loop run till <k. in this case we are starting from equal to k.

so now what next ?
we removed starting left array.
adding next elements.
and then we removing the frequency of the left elments.
and if frequency become equal to 0. then remove this from our map. bcz no need to this again. to use. because this is already we used.
and then our next elments frequency we will add to map.
because its new come and we need to add into our map. for checking 
we added to our map.
and then we also increase our left start value because 0 or first removed.
and then if our map size become equal to k then add to the 
max . what will be the max max will be the currSum and the above or previous sum.

so there also be a catch in the last 9 9 9 is duplicate and our map size will nto be the equal to k. so this case we didn't enter to the count max so that will maintain the distinct order .
and distinct order sum.

so after loop reach n then return the ans.

and we use long variable. because in constrations. the giving the 10 power 5.
k size elements. and the elements lengths also are 10 5 . so might be case.
its reached to the 10 power 10.

so we need to long variable.

ok this is it.

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of nums that meet the following conditions:

The length of the subarray is k, and
All the elements of the subarray are distinct.
Return the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions. If no subarray meets the conditions, return 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 105
