## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/)


There are `n` employees, each with a unique id from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where logs[i] = [id<sub>i</sub>, leaveTime<sub>i</sub>] where:

*   id<sub>i</sub> is the id of the employee that worked on the i<sup>th</sup> task, and
*   leaveTime<sub>i</sub> is the time at which the employee finished the i<sup>th</sup> task. All the values leaveTime<sub>i</sub> are **unique**.

Note that the i<sup>th</sup> task starts the moment right after the (i - 1)<sup>th</sup> task ends, and the 0<sup>th</sup> task starts at time `0`.

Return _the id of the employee that worked the task with the longest time._ If there is a tie between two or more employees, return _the **smallest** id among them_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, logs = [[0,3],[2,5],[0,9],[1,15]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 3 with 3 units of times.
Task 1 started at 3 and ended at 5 with 2 units of times.
Task 2 started at 5 and ended at 9 with 4 units of times.
Task 3 started at 9 and ended at 15 with 6 units of times.
The task with the longest time is task 3 and the employee with id 1 is the one that worked on it, so we return 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 26, logs = [[1,1],[3,7],[2,12],[7,17]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 1 with 1 unit of times.
Task 1 started at 1 and ended at 7 with 6 units of times.
Task 2 started at 7 and ended at 12 with 5 units of times.
Task 3 started at 12 and ended at 17 with 5 units of times.
The tasks with the longest time is task 1\. The employees that worked on it is 3, so we return 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, logs = [[0,10],[1,20]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 10 with 10 units of times.
Task 1 started at 10 and ended at 20 with 10 units of times.
The tasks with the longest time are tasks 0 and 1\. The employees that worked on them are 0 and 1, so we return the smallest id 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 500`
*   `1 <= logs.length <= 500`
*   `logs[i].length == 2`
*   0 <= id<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1
*   1 <= leaveTime<sub>i</sub> <= 500
*   id<sub>i</sub> != id<sub>i+1</sub>
*   leaveTime<sub>i</sub> are sorted in a strictly increasing order.


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int hardestWorker(int n, int[][] logs) {
        n = logs.length;
        int maxTime =0;
        int maxTimeId=0;
        int prev =0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int currWorkTime = logs[i][1]-prev;
            if(currWorkTime>maxTime){
                maxTime = currWorkTime;
                maxTimeId = logs[i][0];
            }else if(currWorkTime==maxTime){
                maxTimeId = Math.min(maxTimeId,logs[i][0]);
            }
            prev = logs[i][1];
        }
        return maxTimeId;
    }
}
/*
declare variable. 
maxTime and maxTimeId.
and prev. for avoid i -1. previous index issue.

now traverse loop till n. 

now check.

currTime will be logs[i][1] 1 is 2nd value. -prev.
now check currTime is greater then maxtime
if it is greater then. put into maxTime and also that currTime location 
maxtime id also update. [0] first value.
and if currtime not greater but iequal means we fount tie.
so we just need to update maxTime Id to Math.min() in this . store MinTimeId value;

and after that update our prev value.

storing prev help to avoid i-1 doing.

after loop over return maxTimeId.;
*/
```


```java
On the Way , we just need to update lexicographical small id with greatest duration.

If the array was unsorted in terms of leaving time, then we would have sorted it , so as to get the time in increasing order.

public int hardestWorker(int n, int[][] a) {
    int len = a[0][1], id = a[0][0];
    for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++){
        int curr = a[i][1] - a[i - 1][1];
        if (curr > len || curr == len && id > a[i][0]){
            len = curr;
            id = a[i][0];
        }
    }
    return id;
}

```




```java
class Solution {
    public int hardestWorker(int n, int[][] logs) {
        int max_val = logs[0][1], id = logs[0][0];
        for(int i=1; i<logs.length; i++){
            int time_req = logs[i][1] - logs[i-1][1];
            if(time_req >= max_val){
                if(time_req == max_val){
                    id = Math.min(id, logs[i][0]);
                }else{
                    max_val = time_req;
                    id = logs[i][0];
                }
            }
        }
        return id;
    }
}

```

```java
2. Using a treemap:
We convert the logs array in such a way that the logs[i][1] is no more the prefix sum. This will give us the actual duration each employee worked for.
logs = [[0,3],[2,5],[0,9],[1,15]] will become [[0,3],[2,2],[0,4],[1,6]].

We create a treemap and put the working duration as key and a list which will contains ids off all employees who has the same working duration as value. (A treemap will sort the keyset (the working durations) for us)
So for [[0,3],[2,2],[0,4],[1,6]] the map would be {2=[2], 3=[0], 4=[0], 6=[1]}.

We return the minimum value in the list mapped to the last key element in the map. Because the last key element is the highest working duration and minimum value in the list is the minimum id value of all employee ids who worked for same duration (if any).

class Solution {
    public int hardestWorker(int n, int[][] logs) {
        int l = logs.length;
        for (int i = l - 1; i > 0 ; i--) {
            logs[i][1] -= logs[i - 1][1];
        }

        TreeMap<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new TreeMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < l; i++) {
            map.putIfAbsent(logs[i][1], new ArrayList<>());
            map.get(logs[i][1]).add(logs[i][0]);
        }

        return Collections.min(map.get(map.lastKey()));
    }
}

// TC: O(n) + O(n * logk) => O(n * logk) - k is the size of treemap
// TC: O(k) - k is the size of treemap

```

```java
class Solution {
    public int hardestWorker(int n, int[][] logs) {
      
        int max = logs[0][1];
        int id = logs[0][0];
        //just traverse and keep track of larger unit time and
        //if they are equal then update our id to smaller within them
        for(int i = 1; i < logs.length ; i++){
            if(max <= logs[i][1]-logs[i-1][1]){
                if(max == logs[i][1]-logs[i-1][1]){
                    id = Math.min(id,logs[i][0]);
                }
                else{
                    max = Math.max(max,logs[i][1]-logs[i-1][1]);
                    id = logs[i][0];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return id;
    }
}

```
