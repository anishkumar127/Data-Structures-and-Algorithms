## Description

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/)


There are `n` employees, each with a unique id from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where logs[i] = [id<sub>i</sub>, leaveTime<sub>i</sub>] where:

*   id<sub>i</sub> is the id of the employee that worked on the i<sup>th</sup> task, and
*   leaveTime<sub>i</sub> is the time at which the employee finished the i<sup>th</sup> task. All the values leaveTime<sub>i</sub> are **unique**.

Note that the i<sup>th</sup> task starts the moment right after the (i - 1)<sup>th</sup> task ends, and the 0<sup>th</sup> task starts at time `0`.

Return _the id of the employee that worked the task with the longest time._ If there is a tie between two or more employees, return _the **smallest** id among them_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, logs = [[0,3],[2,5],[0,9],[1,15]]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 3 with 3 units of times.
Task 1 started at 3 and ended at 5 with 2 units of times.
Task 2 started at 5 and ended at 9 with 4 units of times.
Task 3 started at 9 and ended at 15 with 6 units of times.
The task with the longest time is task 3 and the employee with id 1 is the one that worked on it, so we return 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 26, logs = [[1,1],[3,7],[2,12],[7,17]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 1 with 1 unit of times.
Task 1 started at 1 and ended at 7 with 6 units of times.
Task 2 started at 7 and ended at 12 with 5 units of times.
Task 3 started at 12 and ended at 17 with 5 units of times.
The tasks with the longest time is task 1\. The employees that worked on it is 3, so we return 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, logs = [[0,10],[1,20]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 10 with 10 units of times.
Task 1 started at 10 and ended at 20 with 10 units of times.
The tasks with the longest time are tasks 0 and 1\. The employees that worked on them are 0 and 1, so we return the smallest id 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `2 <= n <= 500`
*   `1 <= logs.length <= 500`
*   `logs[i].length == 2`
*   0 <= id<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1
*   1 <= leaveTime<sub>i</sub> <= 500
*   id<sub>i</sub> != id<sub>i+1</sub>
*   leaveTime<sub>i</sub> are sorted in a strictly increasing order.


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int hardestWorker(int n, int[][] logs) {
        n = logs.length;
        int maxTime =0;
        int maxTimeId=0;
        int prev =0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int currWorkTime = logs[i][1]-prev;
            if(currWorkTime>maxTime){
                maxTime = currWorkTime;
                maxTimeId = logs[i][0];
            }else if(currWorkTime==maxTime){
                maxTimeId = Math.min(maxTimeId,logs[i][0]);
            }
            prev = logs[i][1];
        }
        return maxTimeId;
    }
}
/*
declare variable. 
maxTime and maxTimeId.
and prev. for avoid i -1. previous index issue.

now traverse loop till n. 

now check.

currTime will be logs[i][1] 1 is 2nd value. -prev.
now check currTime is greater then maxtime
if it is greater then. put into maxTime and also that currTime location 
maxtime id also update. [0] first value.
and if currtime not greater but iequal means we fount tie.
so we just need to update maxTime Id to Math.min() in this . store MinTimeId value;

and after that update our prev value.

storing prev help to avoid i-1 doing.

after loop over return maxTimeId.;
