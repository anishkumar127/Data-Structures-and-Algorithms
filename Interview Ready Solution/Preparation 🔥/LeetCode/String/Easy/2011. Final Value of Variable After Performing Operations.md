There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:

*   `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
*   `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return _the **final** value of_ `X` _after performing all the operations_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
*   `operations[i]` will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int sum =0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<operations.length; i++){
            if(operations[i].charAt(1)=='+') sum++;
            else sum--;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
​
/*
tc o(n) sc (1);
 System.out.print(operations[i].charAt(0)+" ");
 
 charAt(0) one case --X or ++X its will be 0 index + or -
 or post increament case  X will be 0 index so code fail.
 for that we choose index 1. because pre or pos both case.  - Or + will be on 1 index.
 
 so whenever we see + we do ++ sum else we do -- sum by one value. 
 its do 1value sum++ because sum= sum+1; its increase by one.
 middle element check every time.
 System.out.print(operations[i].charAt(2)+" ");
 its give X on pre increament.
