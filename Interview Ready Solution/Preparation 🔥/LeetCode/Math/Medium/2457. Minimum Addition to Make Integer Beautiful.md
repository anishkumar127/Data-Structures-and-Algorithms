# [2457\. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-addition-to-make-integer-beautiful/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Medium**  

Related Topics:


You are given two positive integers `n` and `target`.

An integer is considered **beautiful** if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to `target`.

Return the _minimum **non-negative** integer_ `x` _such that_ `n + x` _is beautiful_. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 16, target = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7\. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2\. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 467, target = 6
Output: 33
Explanation: Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17\. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5\. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 1, target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.
```

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= n <= 10<sup>12</sup>
*   `1 <= target <= 150`
*   The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make `n` beautiful.


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
- sab se pehle hum ek getSum name se function bana lenge Jo hamari digit ka sum karega.
like 16 is digit and sum is 1+6 = 7. and digit 467 = 4+6+7 = 17.
​
and then come to our main function.
- assign getSum digit sum to currSum and check if currSum equal or less then to target then simply return it 0.
- may be a case where target and digit sum is equal so there case no adding anything so that its zero 0.
​
-now we create sum variable.
and assign current digt to our curr. and ans =0; and ten is our value of making digit 0. because
in every case we check 1 digit then check 2 digit and then 3.
means of  check we make zero 1 digit and then 2 digit. like
93 we do sum to only ek digit then 3+7 is 0. 
and other cases we need to make 0 for 2 digit needed.
​
ok then next.
- we traverse loop till 15. digit count can be go till 15 digit.
so its long digit.
​
- now what we do. curr  = we do get power. 10.i first case i is zero wo 10^0. 
n is 16 and power of then is 0. so  16/10 we get curr 6. and 467/10 we get 7.
​
then currDigit will be.  16 curr is 6. and 467 is curr 7. so 6%10 is 6. and 7 %10 is 7.
now curr Digit is 6 or 7.
then currDiff we can get difference from the. 10- something. 100 - s0methong 1000-something 
according to the power value of 10.
so here power is 0 then its 10. wo what we do.
 10-currDigit. so currDigit from %10 we got. 6 or 7. so
 10-6. is 4. and 10-7 is 3.
 
 now in our answer varible we update.
 ans = ten*currDift+ans;
 so here. ten is 1 . and currDiff is 4 or 3. and ans is now 0.
 so 1*4+0 = 4. and 1*7+0; = 3.
 
 now we do update our n variable.
 n = n+(ten*currDif);
 so here n is 16. and 467. and ten is 1. and currDif is 4 and 3.
 so  n = 16+(1*4) = 20;
 and n = 467+(1*3)= 470;
 
 and also we update our ten value 10 to increase. wo 1*10. become. 10.
 and wo we have to get our new  n value digit sum. from the getsum function.
 so current n is now 20 and 470. 
 and digit currSum become after getSum return 2+0; = 0. and 4 + 7 + 0 = 11.
 so in case.
 currsum <=target check and if its then return the minimum sum required so we return ans.
 
 so 2<=6. 6 is our target and 2 is our new digit sum.
 
 and 11<=6. not because from 470 we got 11 and target is 6. so we perform again same opration.
 and then return the when we reached to <= target.
