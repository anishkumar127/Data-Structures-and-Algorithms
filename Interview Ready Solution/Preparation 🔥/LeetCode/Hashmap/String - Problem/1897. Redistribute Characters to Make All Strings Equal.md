You are given an array of strings `words` (**0-indexed**).

In one operation, pick two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, where `words[i]` is a non-empty string, and move **any** character from `words[i]` to **any** position in `words[j]`.

Return `true` _if you can make **every** string in_ `words` _**equal** using **any** number of operations_, _and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["ab","a"]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
*   `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean makeEqual(String[] words) {
        int[] mapping = new int[26];
        for(String s:words) for(char ch:s.toCharArray()) mapping[ch-'a']++;
        
        for(int v:mapping) if(!(v%words.length==0)) return false;
        return true;
    }
}
/*
in this question we just mapping all the character frquency and counting them.
​
after that check if any character frequency not equal to % words.length then return false.
​
for example abc , aabc , bc 
in this case words array length is 3. and now we can see.
a=3, b=3, c=3 so that all divisible by 3.
​
here another case. ab, a
in this case a=2 b =1; and words array length is 2.
so a divisble but b not divisble so we can return false. because we can't make equal move any position in this case.
above case we move any character and make them equal.
