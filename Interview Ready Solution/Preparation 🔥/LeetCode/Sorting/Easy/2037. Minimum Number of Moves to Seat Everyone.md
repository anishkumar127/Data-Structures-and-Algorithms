# [2037\. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/)

## Description

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Sorting](https://leetcode.com/tag/sorting/)


There are `n` seats and `n` students in a room. You are given an array `seats` of length `n`, where `seats[i]` is the position of the i<sup>th</sup> seat. You are also given the array `students` of length `n`, where `students[j]` is the position of the j<sup>th</sup> student.

You may perform the following move any number of times:

*   Increase or decrease the position of the i<sup>th</sup> student by `1` (i.e., moving the i<sup>th</sup> student from position `x` to `x + 1` or `x - 1`)

Return _the **minimum number of moves** required to move each student to a seat_ _such that no two students are in the same seat._

Note that there may be **multiple** seats or students in the **same** position at the beginning.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]
Output: 7
Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is not moved.
- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.
- The third student is moved from from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.
- The fourth student is moved from from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.
In total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]
Output: 4
Explanation: Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.
The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.
- The third student is not moved.
- The fourth student is not moved.
In total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == seats.length == students.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 100`
*   `1 <= seats[i], students[j] <= 100`


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMovesToSeat(int[] seats, int[] students) {
        int ans = 0;
        Arrays.sort(seats);
        Arrays.sort(students);
        
        for(int i=0; i<seats.length; i++){
            ans+=Math.abs(seats[i]-students[i]);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
/*
​
in that question sort both the array.
and find difference between them. 
ans add to ans result.
and then return it.
​
​

so. 2-1 = 1;
4 -3  = 1
and 7 -5 = 2;

1 + 1 + 2  = 4;
*/
    
**Analysis:**

// Time: O(nlogn), space: O(S), where n = seats.length, S = space cost during sorting.
```


```java
without absolute math function.
if(seats[i] < students[i]){
                count = count + students[i] - seats[i];
            }
            else{
                count = count + seats[i] -students[i];
            }

```
