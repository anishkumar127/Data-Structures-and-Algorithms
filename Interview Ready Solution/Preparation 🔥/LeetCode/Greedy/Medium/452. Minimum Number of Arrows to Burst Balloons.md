There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where points[i] = [x<sub>start</sub>, x<sub>end</sub>] denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between x<sub>start</sub> and x<sub>end</sub>. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with x<sub>start</sub> and x<sub>end</sub> is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if x<sub>start</sub> <= x <= x<sub>end</sub>. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return _the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

**Constraints:**

*   1 <= points.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
*   `points[i].length == 2`
*   -2<sup>31</sup> <= x<sub>start</sub> < x<sub>end</sub> <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        int count = 0;
        int min = 0;
        
        Arrays.sort(points , (a,b)-> Integer.compare(a[1],b[1]));
        
        
        for(int i=0; i<points.length; i++){
            if(count==0 || min<points[i][0]){
                count++;
                min = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
