You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`.

Return _an array_ `answer` _of length_ `m` _where_ `answer[i]` _is the **maximum** size of a **subsequence** that you can take from_ `nums` _such that the **sum** of its elements is less than or equal to_ `queries[i]`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
- The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3\. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
- The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10\. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
- The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21\. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,4,5], queries = [1]
Output: [0]
Explanation: The empty subsequence is the only subsequence that has a sum less than or equal to 1, so answer[0] = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `m == queries.length`
*   `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
*   1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup>


## Solution

Language: **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] answerQueries(int[] A, int[] queries) {
          Arrays.sort(A);
        int n = A.length, m = queries.length, res[] = new int[m];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            A[i] += A[i - 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int j = Arrays.binarySearch(A, queries[i]);
            res[i] = Math.abs(j + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```




```java
class Solution {
    public int[] answerQueries(int[] nums, int[] queries) {
        // sort 
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // prefix sum.
        for(int i=1; i<nums.length; i++){
            nums[i]+=nums[i-1]; 
        }
        
        int ans [] = new int [queries.length];
        
        for(int i=0; i<queries.length; i++){
            
            int q = queries[i];
            
            // apply binary search.
            int low = 0,  high = nums.length-1;
            
            while(low <= high){
                int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
                
                if(nums[mid]==q){
                    ans[i] = mid + 1;
                    break;
                    
                }else if(nums[mid] < q){
                    
                    ans[i] = mid + 1;
                    low = mid + 1;
                    
                }else{
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
            
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
